<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.
I am a Cybersecurity major here at MSU.
I am interested in ethical hacking as well as systems administration.
This is my first class here, however in the future I hope to take "Making millions of dollars 220"
My biggest hobbies are collecting trading cards/collectables as well as information security.
